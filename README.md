# ObjectRecognition
This is my first project utilizing computer vision techniques. I implemented a pre-trained model (YoloV4) with the Python OpenCV and Numpy libraries.
I then developed a CV program where the system automatically opens the respective laptopâ€™s camera, recognizes its trained objects, and labels them as the user presents the item while being recorded. I also included a Python program that creates a button-like interface to make the overall system interactive and easy to use. This model is trained to detect 80 items, which can be found in the classes.txt file in the dnn_model folder.
I want to expand this project in the future to be able to detect objects like cars on a busy road or pedestrians walking on the sidewalk in order to enhance the practically of this program in the real world.
